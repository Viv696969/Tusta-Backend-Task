### *Slide 1: Title Slide*
*Speaker Notes:*
- Welcome everyone to the presentation on the "Word-Based Indian Sign Language Translator Using Seq-2-Seq Model."
- I am Vivek Chouhan, and today I will walk you through the development of a real-time ISL translator designed to bridge communication gaps for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India.
- This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision to interpret Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures and convert them into text or speech.

### *Slide 3: Introduction*
*Speaker Notes:*
- The primary problem we’re addressing is the communication barrier faced by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India, which affects approximately 63 million people according to the WHO.
- Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a visual language with unique grammar and syntax, making it essential for communication within this community.
- Currently, the Deaf community relies heavily on human interpreters or small communication diaries, which are not always practical or accessible.
- Our objective is to develop a smart system that can recognize ISL gestures in real-time with low latency and convert them into proper sentences.
- ISL is complex because it involves the use of both hands, facial expressions, and body language, making it challenging to interpret using traditional methods.

### *Slide 4: Materials and Methods*
*Speaker Notes:*
- To develop this system, we used *OpenCV* and *MediaPipe* for landmark recognition of ISL gestures.
- The core of the system is a *Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model* built using *TensorFlow*, which is well-suited for handling sequential data like sign language gestures.
- We collected a comprehensive dataset from students at the *Bombay Institute of Deaf and Mutes (BIDM)*, which included 900 data points for six common ISL actions: "Hello," "How Are You," "Thank You," "Sorry," "Welcome," and "Blank."
- Each data point consists of 30 frames, with each frame containing 1662 landmarks. MediaPipe’s holistic model was used to extract 543 landmarks, including face, hand, and pose landmarks.

---

### *Slide 5: Materials and Methods (Data Collection Process)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- The data collection process involved recording ISL gestures performed by students at BIDM.
- We ensured that the dataset was diverse and representative of real-world ISL usage.
- Each gesture was captured in 30 frames, and MediaPipe was used to extract key landmarks from the face, hands, and body pose.
- This data was then preprocessed and fed into the Seq2Seq model for training.

---

### *Slide 6: Materials and Methods (Depth Detection)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- One of the challenges in real-time gesture recognition is ensuring that the user is positioned correctly relative to the camera.
- To address this, we implemented a *depth detection algorithm* that ensures the subject is at the correct depth during inference.
- Additionally, we added a *ready model* that automates the process and checks if the user is ready to start inference, reducing the need for human intervention.

---

### *Slide 7: Materials and Methods (GRU Architecture)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- For the model architecture, we chose *Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)* because of their ability to handle sequential data efficiently while maintaining end-to-end semantics.
- The model consists of 7 layers, including input, GRU, dense, and output layers.
- We trained the model using *categorical cross-entropy loss* and the *Adam optimizer*, which are standard for classification tasks.

---

### *Slide 8: Materials and Methods (Algorithm of the Proposed System)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- The algorithm of the proposed system involves several steps:
  1. *Gesture Capture*: The system captures ISL gestures using a camera.
  2. *Landmark Extraction*: MediaPipe extracts 543 landmarks from the face, hands, and body.
  3. *Data Preprocessing*: The landmarks are preprocessed and fed into the GRU model.
  4. *Inference*: The model predicts the corresponding text or speech output in real-time.
- This process ensures low latency and high accuracy in translating ISL gestures.

---

### *Slide 9: Results and Discussion (Accuracy)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- The GRU model achieved a *98.98% testing accuracy*, outperforming both LSTM and Simple RNN models.
- This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of GRUs in handling sequential data like ISL gestures.
- The model also required fewer epochs to train compared to LSTM and Simple RNN, making it more efficient.

---

### *Slide 10: Results and Discussion (Training Stats)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- During training, the loss decreased exponentially until the 11th epoch, after which it gradually decreased to *0.01%* by the final epoch.
- This indicates that the model converged well and was able to learn the patterns in the ISL gestures effectively.

---

### *Slide 11: Results and Discussion (Sentence Formation)*
*Speaker Notes:*
- During inference, the system successfully formed sentences while performing ISL actions.
- This demonstrates the real-time capabilities of the system and its potential to facilitate seamless communication for the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community.

---

### *Slide 12: Conclusion*
*Speaker Notes:*
- In conclusion, this project presents a real-time Indian Sign Language Translator using a Seq2Seq model.
- The system, developed with TensorFlow, OpenCV, and MediaPipe, translates ISL gestures into text or speech with high accuracy.
- By incorporating depth detection and readiness checks, the system ensures accurate inference and enhances communication for the Deaf community in India.
- This project has the potential to significantly improve the quality of life for millions of people by breaking down communication barriers.
